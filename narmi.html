							<h1>Narmi Banking Alexa Skill</h1>
                            <p class="about">As me and my 3 friends journeyed across states to Georgetown for Hoya Hacks, we brainstormed ideas in an attempt to decide what to build throughout the hackathon. Upon arrival, still inconclusive about our project, we took a stroll around the venue and talked to the companies set up there. Narmi, a company that enables banks and credit unions to deliver their own digital service, proposed the idea of using their new banking API to create an Alexa Skill. Having already discussed different FinTech solutions as possibilities, we decided to jump at the opportunity.</p>
                            <p class="about"> Using Javascript with Node.JS, I was in charge of using the Narmi API to implement our desired features and incorporate that into an AWS Lambda. There were a few hiccups along the way as the Node API had some issues, but they were easily ironed out as I worked with the engineering lead from Narmi. None of us had attemped to develop an Alexa Skill before so it was exciting traversing the development kit they offered. After 2 nights spent at the University we produced a skill that allowed the user to ask questions using natural language to access their important banking features. For example:</p>
                            <h2 class="quote">"What is my current balance?"</h2>
                            <h2 class="quote">"Transfer money from my primary account to my secondary account."</h2>
                            <h2 class="quote">"What is my transaction history?"</h2>
                            <p class="about">Overall, it was a very insightful and beneficial experience as we jumped head first into a new technology. A demo of our skill can be seen below as posted by Narmi themselves.</p>
